# Session title and cloud runs

## Session title

The chat's name is how the human finds one delegator session among several, in the Claude Code on the web sidebar, the `/resume` picker and the terminal title, so a session names itself after the item it holds. The title changes at these moments, and only when the new title differs from `title` in `run-state.json`:

| Moment | Title |
|---|---|
| **Work** step 2, once the claim on issue N wins | `#N <issue title>` |
| **Review** step 1, once the claim on PR P wins | `Review PR #P <PR title>` |
| **Land** step 1, once the claim on PR P wins | `Land PR #P <PR title>` |
| A **Watch** or **Run** pass ends holding no claim | `/delegate watching <owner>/<repo>` |

Cut the item's title at a word boundary with `…` so the whole stays within 60 characters. A Work, Review or Land the human started by hand keeps its item's title when it stops, and so does a run that trips the **Stop rule** or goes to **Blocked**: the title still says where the staged work is. Only a Watch or Run pass sets the watching form, and only at its end.

Set it with one call, counted in `tool_calls`, and write the new title to `run-state.json`. A rename that fails is reported in one line of the pass report and never stops a run: the title is a convenience.

- **Claude Code on the web.** The `set_session_title` tool of the `claude-code-remote` MCP server, whenever it is in the tool list. Its `session_id` is the `ccr.id` that `get_session` returns when called once per run with no arguments; keep it in `run-state.json` as `ccr_session_id`. That is the id the sidebar knows; `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` is a different id and is not it.
- **The CLI.** No tool renames a session and a skill cannot run `/rename`. `/rename` itself appends a `custom-title` record to the session transcript, and Claude Code picks one up that another process appended the next time it reads the end of its transcript (after about 32 KB of its own writes, or at a compaction), so append the same record:

  ```bash
  jq -nc --arg t "<title>" --arg s "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID" \
    '{type:"custom-title",customTitle:$t,sessionId:$s}' \
    >> ~/.claude/projects/*/"$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID".jsonl
  ```

  `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` is set in every Claude Code session and exactly one transcript carries that name, so the glob expands to the one file. The redirect fails with `ambiguous redirect` when it does not; report that and carry on.

## Running in a cloud container

Advice to the human, not instructions to the delegator:

- Run `/delegate` in a dedicated environment with only the GitHub connector attached; every attached MCP server's tool list is loaded on every turn.
- Do not run it with the `learning` output style or any output style that adds per-turn commentary.
- A worktree carries a second copy of the project's `CLAUDE.md`. With the delegator staying in the main checkout, that copy no longer loads into the delegator's context on every turn, which is one more reason the delegator never enters a worktree.
- A global stop hook that nags to commit and push (the dotfiles `stop-hook-git-check.sh`) fires on every delegator stop while staged work is intentionally uncommitted. That hook stays silent when the worktree holds a `.delegator/` marker directory or `DELEGATOR_RUN=1` is set; **Work** step 5 creates the marker.
